Development on \code{TOSTtwo} is complete, and for new code we recommend
switching to \link{tsum_TOST}, which is easier to use, more featureful,
and still under active development.

\examples{
## Eskine (2013) showed that participants who had been exposed to organic
## food were substantially harsher in their moral judgments relative to
## those exposed to control (d = 0.81, 95\% CI: [0.19, 1.45]). A
## replication by Moery & Calin-Jageman (2016, Study 2) did not observe
## a significant effect (Control: n = 95, M = 5.25, SD = 0.95, Organic
## Food: n = 89, M = 5.22, SD = 0.83). Following Simonsohn's (2015)
## recommendation the equivalence bound was set to the effect size the
## original study had 33\% power to detect (with n = 21 in each condition,
## this means the equivalence bound is d = 0.48, which equals a
## difference of 0.384 on a 7-point scale given the sample sizes and a
## pooled standard deviation of 0.894). Using a TOST equivalence test
## with default alpha = 0.05, not assuming equal variances, and equivalence
## bounds of d = -0.43 and d = 0.43 is significant, t(182) = -2.69,
## p = 0.004. We can reject effects larger than d = 0.43.
