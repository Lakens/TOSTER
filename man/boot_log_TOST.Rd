\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of positive data values on a ratio scale.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of positive data values on a ratio scale.}

\item{hypothesis}{'EQU' for equivalence (default), or 'MET' for minimal effects test.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal.}

\item{eqb}{Equivalence bound expressed as a ratio. Can provide 1 value (e.g., 1.25 for bounds of 0.8 and 1.25)
or 2 specific values that represent the lower and upper equivalence bounds (e.g., c(0.8, 1.25)).}

\item{alpha}{alpha level (default = 0.05).}

\item{null}{the ratio value under the null hypothesis (default = 1).}

\item{boot_ci}{method for bootstrap confidence interval calculation: "stud" (studentized, default),
"basic" (basic bootstrap), or "perc" (percentile bootstrap).}

\item{R}{number of bootstrap replications (default = 1999).}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form lhs ~ rhs where lhs is a numeric variable giving the data values and rhs either 1 for a one-sample or paired test or a factor with two levels giving the corresponding groups. If lhs is of class "Pair" and rhs is 1, a paired test is done.}

\item{data}{an optional matrix or data frame (or similar: see model.frame) containing the variables in the formula formula. By default the variables are taken from environment(formula).}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used.}

\item{na.action}{a function indicating what should happen when the data contain NAs.}

Performs equivalence testing using the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure with bootstrapped
log-transformed t-tests. This approach is particularly useful for ratio-scale data where the
equivalence bounds are expressed as ratios (e.g., bioequivalence studies).
}
\details{
The function implements a bootstrap method for log-transformed TOST as recommended by
He et al. (2022) and corresponds to the proposal in Chapter 16 of Efron and Tibshirani (1994).
This is approximately equivalent to the percentile bootstrap method mentioned by He et al. (2014).

For two-sample tests, the test is of \eqn{\bar log(x) - \bar log(y)} which corresponds to testing
the ratio of geometric means. For paired samples, the test is of difference scores on the log scale,
\eqn{z = log(x) - log(y) = log(x/y)}, which also corresponds to a ratio test.

The bootstrap procedure follows these steps:
\itemize{
\item Log-transform the data
\item Perform resampling with replacement to generate bootstrap samples
\item For each bootstrap sample, calculate test statistics and effect sizes
\item Use the distribution of bootstrap results to compute p-values and confidence intervals
\item Back-transform for the ratio of means
}

Note that all input data must be positive (ratio scale with a true zero) since log transformation
is applied. The function will stop with an error if any negative values are detected.

For details on the calculations in this function see \code{vignette("robustTOST")}.

\section{Purpose}{

Use this function when:
\itemize{
\item Your data is on a ratio scale (all values must be positive)
\item You want to establish equivalence based on the ratio of means rather than their difference
\item Traditional parametric methods may not be appropriate due to skewed distributions
\item You need to analyze bioequivalence data where bounds are expressed as ratios
}

\examples{
# Example 1: Two-Sample Test for Bioequivalence
# Generate ratio scale data (e.g., drug concentrations)
test_group <- rlnorm(30, meanlog = 3.5, sdlog = 0.4)
ref_group <- rlnorm(30, meanlog = 3.6, sdlog = 0.4)

# FDA standard bioequivalence bounds (80\% to 125\%)
result <- boot_log_TOST(x = test_group,
                        y = ref_group,
                        eqb = 1.25,  # Creates bounds of 0.8 and 1.25
                        R = 999)     # Reduce for demonstration

# Example 2: Paired Sample Test
# Generate paired ratio scale data
n <- 20
baseline <- rlnorm(n, meanlog = 4, sdlog = 0.3)
followup <- baseline * rlnorm(n, meanlog = 0.05, sdlog = 0.2)

# Test with asymmetric bounds
result <- boot_log_TOST(x = followup,
                        y = baseline,
                        paired = TRUE,
                        eqb = c(0.85, 1.20),
                        boot_ci = "perc")
