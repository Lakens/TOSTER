\title{Power analysis for TOST for independent t-test (raw scores).}
\usage{
powerTOSTtwo.raw(alpha, statistical_power, N, sdpooled, low_eqbound,
  high_eqbound)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha used for the test (e.g., 0.05)}

\item{statistical_power}{desired power (e.g., 0.8)}

\item{N}{sample size per group (e.g., 108)}

\item{sdpooled}{specify the pooled standard deviation}

\item{low_eqbound}{lower equivalence bounds (e.g., -0.5) expressed in raw scale units (e.g., scalepoints)}

\item{high_eqbound}{upper equivalence bounds (e.g., 0.5) expressed in raw scale units (e.g., scalepoints)}
}
\value{
Calculate either achieved power, equivalence bounds, or required N.
Returns a string summarizing the power analysis, and a numeric variable for number of observations, equivalence bounds, or power.

## Sample size for alpha = 0.05, 80\% power, equivalence bounds of -200 and 200 in raw
## units, assuming pooled standard deviation of 350, and assuming true effect = 0

## Power for alpha = 0.05, N = 53 per group, equivalence bounds of
## -200 and 200 in raw units, assuming sdpooled = 350 and true effect = 0

## Equivalence bounds for alpha = 0.05, N = 108 per group, statistical power of
