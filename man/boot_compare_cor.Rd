\arguments{
\item{x1, y1}{numeric vectors of data values. x and y must have the same length from study 1.}

\item{x2, y2}{numeric vectors of data values. x and y must have the same length from study 2.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis:
\itemize{
\item "two.sided": correlation is not equal to null (default)
\item "greater": correlation is greater than null
\item "less": correlation is less than null
\item "equivalence": correlation is within the equivalence bounds (TOST)
\item "minimal.effect": correlation is outside the equivalence bounds (TOST)
}

You can specify just the initial letter.}

\item{method}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient to use:
\itemize{
\item "pearson": standard Pearson product-moment correlation
\item "kendall": Kendall's tau rank correlation
\item "spearman": Spearman's rho rank correlation
\item "winsorized": Winsorized correlation (robust to outliers)
\item "bendpercent": percentage bend correlation (robust to marginal outliers)
}

Can be abbreviated.}

\item{alpha}{alpha level (default = 0.05)}

\item{null}{a number or vector indicating the null hypothesis value(s):
\itemize{
\item For standard tests: a single value (default = 0)
\item For equivalence/minimal effect tests: either a single value (symmetric bounds Â±value will be created)
or a vector of two values representing the lower and upper bounds
}}

\item{R}{number of bootstrap replications (default = 1999).}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to correlation functions, such as:
\itemize{
\item trim: for Winsorized correlation (default = 0.2)
\item beta: for percentage bend correlation (default = 0.2)
}}
}
\value{
A list with class "htest" containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item "p.value": numeric scalar containing the p-value for the test under the null hypothesis.
\item "estimate": difference in correlations between studies.
\item "conf.int": percentile (bootstrap) confidence interval for difference in correlations.
\item "null.value": the specified hypothesized value for the null hypothesis.
\item "alternative": character string indicating the alternative hypothesis (the value of the input argument alternative). Possible values are "greater", "less", or "two-sided".
\item "method": a character string indicating how the association was measured.
\item "data.name": Names of input values.
\item "boot_res": List of bootstrapped results.
\item "call": the matched call.

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable}{\figure{lifecycle-stable.svg}{options: alt='[Stable]'}}}{\strong{[Stable]}}

A function to compare standardized mean differences (SMDs) between studies.
This function is intended to be used to compare the compatibility of original studies with replication studies
(lower p-values indicating lower compatibility).
