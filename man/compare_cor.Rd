\title{Comparing two independent correlation coefficients}
\usage{
compare_cor(
  r1,
  df1,
  r2,
  df2,
  method = c("fisher", "kraatz"),
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater", "equivalence", "minimal.effect"),
  null = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{r1}{Correlation study 1.}

\item{df1}{Degrees of freedom from study 1 (if a simple correlation the df is N-2).}

\item{r2}{Correlation study 2.}

\item{df2}{Degrees of freedom from study 2 (if a simple correlation the df is N-2).}

\item{method}{Method for determining differences. Default, "z", will use Fisher's transformation, while "Kraatz" will use the Kraatz method.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater", "less", "equivalence" (TOST), or "minimal.effect" (TOST). You can specify just the initial letter.}

\item{null}{a number indicating the null hypothesis. For TOST, this would be equivalence bound.}
}
\description{
A function to compare correlations between studies. This function is intended to be used to compare the compatibility of original studies with replication studies (lower p-values indicating lower compatibility).
}
\details{
This function tests for differences between correlations.
 @return A list with class "htest" containing the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"statistic"}}{z-score}
  \item{\code{"p.value"}}{numeric scalar containing the p-value for the test under the null hypothesis.}
  \item{\code{"estimate"}}{difference in SMD between studies}
  \item{\code{"null.value"}}{the specified hypothesized value for the null hypothesis.}
  \item{\code{"alternative"}}{character string indicating the alternative hypothesis (the value of the input argument alternative). Possible values are "greater", "less", or "two-sided".}
  \item{\code{"method"}}{Type of SMD}
  \item{\code{"data.name"}}{"Summary Statistics" to denote summary statistics were utilized to obtain results.}
  \item{\code{"cor"}}{Correlation input for the function.}
  \item{\code{"call"}}{the matched call.}
}
