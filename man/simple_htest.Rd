}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from the underlying test functions.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test. Cannot be used with the formula method; use x and y vectors instead for paired tests.}

\item{alternative}{the alternative hypothesis:
- "two.sided": different from mu (default)
- "less": less than mu
- "greater": greater than mu
- "equivalence": between specified bounds
- "minimal.effect": outside specified bounds}

\item{mu}{a number or vector specifying the null hypothesis value(s):
- For standard alternatives (two.sided, less, greater): a single value (default: 0)
- For equivalence/minimal.effect: either a single value (symmetric bounds will be created) or a vector of two values representing the lower and upper bounds}

\item{alpha}{alpha level (default = 0.05)}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{test}{a character string specifying the type of hypothesis test to use:
- "t.test": Student's t-test (parametric, default)
- "wilcox.test": Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric)

You can specify just the initial letter (e.g., "t" for "t.test").}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form lhs ~ rhs where lhs is a numeric variable giving the data values and rhs either 1 for a one-sample test or a factor with two levels giving the corresponding groups. For paired tests, use the default method with x and y vectors instead of the formula method.}

\item{data}{an optional matrix or data frame (or similar: see model.frame) containing the variables in the formula formula. By default the variables are taken from environment(formula).}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used.}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs. Defaults to getOption("na.action").}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"htest"} containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item statistic: the value of the test statistic.
\item parameter: the parameter(s) for the test statistic (e.g., degrees of freedom for t-tests).
\item p.value: the p-value for the test.
\item conf.int: a confidence interval appropriate to the specified alternative hypothesis.
\item estimate: the estimated effect (e.g., mean difference for t-tests).
\item null.value: the specified hypothesized value(s). For equivalence and minimal effect tests, this will be two values.
\item stderr: the standard error of the estimate (for t-tests).
\item alternative: a character string describing the alternative hypothesis.
\item method: a character string indicating what type of test was performed.
\item data.name: a character string giving the name(s) of the data.
}

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#maturing}{\figure{lifecycle-maturing.svg}{options: alt='[Maturing]'}}}{\strong{[Maturing]}}

Performs statistical hypothesis tests with extended functionality beyond standard implementations.
Supports t-tests and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests with additional
alternatives such as equivalence and minimal effect testing.
}
\details{
This function provides a unified interface to several common hypothesis tests with expanded
alternative hypotheses, particularly for equivalence testing and minimal effect testing.

When \code{alternative = "equivalence"}, the test evaluates whether the effect is contained
within the bounds specified by \code{mu}. This corresponds to the alternative hypothesis that
the true effect is between the specified bounds. The function performs two one-sided tests and
returns the most conservative result (highest p-value).

When \code{alternative = "minimal.effect"}, the test evaluates whether the effect is outside
the bounds specified by \code{mu}. This corresponds to the alternative hypothesis that the true
effect is either less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound. The function performs
two one-sided tests and returns the most significant result (lowest p-value).

For standard alternatives ("two.sided", "less", "greater"), the function behaves similarly to
the underlying test functions with some additional standardization in the output format.

The interpretation of \code{mu} depends on the test used:
\itemize{
\item For t-test: mu represents the difference in means (default: 0)
\item For wilcox.test: mu represents the location shift (default: 0)
}

If \code{mu} is a single value for equivalence or minimal effect alternatives, symmetric bounds
will be created automatically as c(mu, -mu).
}
\section{Purpose}{

Use this function when:
\itemize{
\item You need a unified interface for different types of hypothesis tests
\item You want to perform equivalence testing or minimal effect testing with non-parametric methods
\item You need more flexibility in hypothesis testing than provided by standard functions
\item You want to easily switch between parametric and non-parametric methods
}

\examples{
# Example 1: Basic t-test with equivalence alternative
# Testing if the difference in mpg between automatic and manual transmission cars
# is equivalent within ±3 units
data(mtcars)
simple_htest(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, alternative = "equivalence", mu = 3)

# Example 2: Using a non-parametric test with minimal effect alternative
# Testing if the effect of transmission type on mpg is meaningfully large
# (either less than -2 or greater than 2)
simple_htest(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars,
             test = "wilcox",
             alternative = "minimal.effect",
             mu = c(-2, 2))

# Example 3: Paired samples test
# Using the sleep dataset to test if drug has an effect on sleep
data(sleep)
with(sleep, simple_htest(x = extra[group == 1],
                        y = extra[group == 2],
                        paired = TRUE,
                        alternative = "greater"))
