}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{hypothesis}{'EQU' for equivalence (default), or 'MET' for minimal effects test.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal. If TRUE then the pooled variance is used to estimate the variance otherwise the Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is used.}

\item{eqb}{Equivalence bound. Can provide 1 value (symmetric bound, negative value is taken as the lower bound) or 2 specific values that represent the upper and lower equivalence bounds.}

\item{low_eqbound}{lower equivalence bounds (deprecated, use \code{eqb} instead).}

\item{high_eqbound}{upper equivalence bounds (deprecated, use \code{eqb} instead).}

\item{eqbound_type}{Type of equivalence bound. Can be 'SMD' for standardized mean difference (i.e., Cohen's d) or 'raw' for the mean difference. Default is 'raw'. Raw is strongly recommended as SMD bounds will produce biased results.}

\item{alpha}{alpha level (default = 0.05)}

\item{bias_correction}{Apply Hedges' correction for bias (default is TRUE).}

\item{rm_correction}{Repeated measures correction to make standardized mean difference Cohen's d(rm). This only applies to repeated/paired samples. Default is FALSE.}

\item{glass}{Option to calculate Glass's delta instead of Cohen's d style SMD ('glass1' uses first group's SD, 'glass2' uses second group's SD).}

\item{mu}{a number indicating the true value of the mean for the two-tailed test (default = 0).}

\item{R}{number of bootstrap replications (default = 1999).}

\item{boot_ci}{method for bootstrap confidence interval calculation: "stud" (studentized, default), "basic" (basic bootstrap), or "perc" (percentile bootstrap).}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form lhs ~ rhs where lhs is a numeric variable giving the data values and rhs either 1 for a one-sample or paired test or a factor with two levels giving the corresponding groups. If lhs is of class "Pair" and rhs is 1, a paired test is done.}

\item{data}{an optional matrix or data frame (or similar: see model.frame) containing the variables in the formula formula. By default the variables are taken from environment(formula).}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used.}

\item{na.action}{a function indicating what should happen when the data contain NAs.}

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable}{\figure{lifecycle-stable.svg}{options: alt='[Stable]'}}}{\strong{[Stable]}}

Performs equivalence testing using the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure with bootstrapped t-tests.
This provides a robust alternative to traditional TOST when data may not meet all parametric assumptions.
}
\details{
The function implements a bootstrap method for TOST as described in Chapter 16 of Efron and Tibshirani (1994).
This approach provides a robust alternative to traditional parametric TOST when data distributions may not
meet standard assumptions.

The bootstrap procedure follows these steps:
\itemize{
\item Resample with replacement from the original data to create R bootstrap samples
\item For each bootstrap sample, calculate test statistics and effect sizes
\item Use the distribution of bootstrap results to compute p-values and confidence intervals
\item Combine results using the specified bootstrap confidence interval method
}

Three types of bootstrap confidence intervals are available:
\itemize{
\item Studentized ("stud"): Accounts for the variability in the standard error estimate
\item Basic/Empirical ("basic"): Uses the empirical distribution of bootstrap estimates
\item Percentile ("perc"): Uses percentiles of the bootstrap distribution
}

For two-sample tests, the test is of \eqn{\bar x - \bar y} (mean of x minus mean of y).
For paired samples, the test is of the difference scores (z),
wherein \eqn{z = x - y}, and the test is of \eqn{\bar z} (mean of the difference scores).
For one-sample tests, the test is of \eqn{\bar x} (mean of x).

For details on the calculations in this function see \code{vignette("robustTOST")}.

\section{Purpose}{

Use this function when:
\itemize{
\item You want more robust confidence intervals for your effect sizes
\item Sample sizes are small and parametric assumptions may not hold
\item You want to avoid relying on asymptotic approximations

# Example 1: Two-Sample Test with Symmetric Bounds
set.seed(1234)
group1 <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)
group2 <- rnorm(30, mean = 5.5, sd = 2.2)

# Using symmetric bounds of ±1.5
result <- boot_t_TOST(x = group1,
                     y = group2,
                     eqb = 1.5,
                     R = 999)  # Using fewer replications for demonstration

# Example 2: Paired Sample Test with Percentile Bootstrap
set.seed(5678)
pre <- rnorm(25, mean = 100, sd = 15)
post <- pre + rnorm(25, mean = 3, sd = 10)

result <- boot_t_TOST(x = pre,
                     y = post,
                     paired = TRUE,
                     eqb = c(-5, 8),  # Asymmetric bounds
                     boot_ci = "perc")

# Example 3: One Sample Test
set.seed(9101)
scores <- rnorm(40, mean = 0.3, sd = 1)

# Testing if mean is equivalent to zero within ±0.5 units
result <- boot_t_TOST(x = scores,
                     eqb = 0.5,
                     boot_ci = "basic")
