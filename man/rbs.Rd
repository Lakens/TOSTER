\title{Non-parametric standardized effect sizes (replicates of ses_calc)}
\usage{
rbs(x, y = NULL, mu = 0, conf.level = 0.95, paired = FALSE)

np_ses(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  mu = 0,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  paired = FALSE,
  ses = c("rb", "odds", "cstat")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{mu}{a number indicating the value around which (a-)symmetry (for
one-sample or paired samples) or shift (for independent samples) is to be
estimated. See [stats::wilcox.test].}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the interval.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want to calculate a paired test.}

\item{ses}{Rank-biserial (rb), odds (odds), and concordance probablity (cstat).}
}
\value{
Returns a list of results including the rank biserial correlation, logical indicator if it was a paired method, setting for mu, and confidence interval.

\description{
Effect sizes for simple (one or two sample) non-parametric tests.
}
\details{
This method was adapted from the effectsize R package.
The rank-biserial correlation is appropriate for non-parametric tests of
differences - both for the one sample or paired samples case, that would
normally be tested with Wilcoxon's Signed Rank Test (giving the
**matched-pairs** rank-biserial correlation) and for two independent samples
case, that would normally be tested with Mann-Whitney's *U* Test (giving
**Glass'** rank-biserial correlation). See [stats::wilcox.test]. In both
cases, the correlation represents the difference between the proportion of
favorable and unfavorable pairs / signed ranks (Kerby, 2014). Values range
from `-1` indicating that all values of the second sample are smaller than
the first sample, to `+1` indicating that all values of the second sample are
larger than the first sample.

In addition, the rank-biserial correlation can be transformed into a
concordance probability (i.e., probability of superiority) or into a
generalized odds (WMW odds or Agresti's generalized odds ratio).

## Ties
When tied values occur, they are each given the average of the ranks that
would have been given had no ties occurred. No other corrections have been
implemented yet.

# Confidence Intervals
Confidence intervals for the standardized effect sizes
are estimated using the normal approximation (via Fisher's transformation).
