\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test. Cannot be used with the formula method; use x and y vectors instead for paired tests.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal. If TRUE then the pooled variance is used to estimate the variance otherwise the Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is used.}

\item{alpha}{alpha level (default = 0.05)}

\item{bias_correction}{Apply Hedges' correction for bias (default is TRUE).}

\item{rm_correction}{Repeated measures correction to make standardized mean difference Cohen's d(rm). This only applies to repeated/paired samples. Default is FALSE.}

\item{glass}{Option to calculate Glass's delta instead of Cohen's d style SMD ('glass1' uses first group's SD, 'glass2' uses second group's SD).}

\item{boot_ci}{method for bootstrap confidence interval calculation: "stud" (studentized, default), "basic" (basic bootstrap), or "perc" (percentile bootstrap).}

\item{R}{number of bootstrap replications (default = 1999).}

\item{output}{a character string specifying the output format:
- "htest": (default) Returns an object of class "htest" compatible with standard R output.
- "data.frame": Returns a data frame for backward compatibility.}

\item{null.value}{a number or vector specifying the null hypothesis value(s) on the SMD scale:
- For standard alternatives: a single value (default = 0)
- For equivalence/minimal.effect: two values representing the lower and upper bounds}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis:
- "none": (default) No hypothesis test is performed; only effect size and CI are returned.
- "two.sided": Test whether SMD differs from null.value
- "less": Test whether SMD is less than null.value
- "greater": Test whether SMD is greater than null.value
- "equivalence": Test whether SMD is between specified bounds
- "minimal.effect": Test whether SMD is outside specified bounds}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{mu}{null value to adjust the calculation. If non-zero, the function calculates x-y-mu (default = 0).}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form lhs ~ rhs where lhs is a numeric variable giving the data values and rhs either 1 for a one-sample test or a factor with two levels giving the corresponding groups. For paired tests, use the default method with x and y vectors instead of the formula method.}

\item{data}{an optional matrix or data frame (or similar: see model.frame) containing the variables in the formula formula. By default the variables are taken from environment(formula).}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used.}

\item{na.action}{a function indicating what should happen when the data contain NAs.}

Calculates standardized mean differences (SMDs) with bootstrap confidence intervals,
with optional hypothesis testing.
}
\details{
This function calculates bootstrapped confidence intervals for standardized mean differences.
It is an extension of the \code{smd_calc()} function that uses resampling to provide more robust
confidence intervals, especially for small sample sizes or when data violate assumptions
of parametric methods.

The function implements the following bootstrap approach:
\itemize{
\item Calculate the raw SMD and its standard error using the original data
\item Create R bootstrap samples by resampling with replacement from the original data
\item Calculate the SMD and its standard error for each bootstrap sample
\item Calculate confidence intervals using the specified method
}

Three bootstrap confidence interval methods are available:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Studentized bootstrap ("stud")}: Accounts for the variability in standard error estimates. Usually provides the most accurate coverage probability and is set as the default.
\item \strong{Basic bootstrap ("basic")}: Uses the empirical distribution of bootstrap estimates. Simple approach that works well for symmetric distributions.
\item \strong{Percentile bootstrap ("perc")}: Uses percentiles of the bootstrap distribution directly. More robust to skewness in the bootstrap distribution.
}

The function supports various SMD variants:
\itemize{
\item Classic standardized mean difference (bias_correction = FALSE)
\item Bias-corrected version (bias_correction = TRUE)
\item Glass's delta: Uses only one group's standard deviation as the denominator (glass = "glass1" or "glass2")
\item Repeated measures d: Accounts for correlation in paired designs (rm_correction = TRUE)
}

The function supports three study designs:
\itemize{
\item One-sample design: Standardizes the difference between the sample mean and zero (or other specified value)
\item Two-sample independent design: Standardizes the difference between two group means
\item Paired samples design: Standardizes the mean difference between paired observations
}

\section{Purpose}{

Use this function when:
\itemize{
\item You need more robust confidence intervals for standardized mean differences
\item You want to account for non-normality or heterogeneity in your effect size estimates
\item Sample sizes are small or standard error approximations may be unreliable
\item You prefer resampling-based confidence intervals over parametric approximations
\item You need to quantify uncertainty in SMD estimates more accurately
\item You want to test hypotheses about effect size magnitudes using bootstrap methods
}
