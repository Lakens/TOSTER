}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{...}{further arguments (currently ignored).}

\item{y}{an optional (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{alternative}{the alternative hypothesis:
- "two.sided": different from mu (default)
- "less": less than mu
- "greater": greater than mu
- "equivalence": between specified bounds
- "minimal.effect": outside specified bounds}

\item{mu}{a number or vector specifying the null hypothesis value(s):
* For standard alternatives: for standard alternatives (two.sided, less, greater): a single value (default: 0
* For equivalence/minimal.effect: either a single value (symmetric bounds will be created) or a vector of two values representing the lower and upper bounds}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal.
If \code{TRUE} then the pooled variance is used to estimate the variance otherwise the Welch
(or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is used. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{alpha}{significance level (default = 0.05).}

\item{tr}{the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trimmed from each end before
computing the mean and winsorized variance. Default is 0 (no trimming).
When tr > 0, the function performs Yuen's trimmed t-test.}

\item{R}{the number of permutations. Default is NULL, which computes all exact permutations.
If R is specified and is less than the maximum number of possible permutations,
randomization (permutation with replacement) is used instead.}

\item{symmetric}{a logical variable indicating whether to assume symmetry in the two-sided test.
If \code{TRUE} (default) then the symmetric permutation p-value is computed, otherwise the
equal-tail permutation p-value is computed. Only relevant for \code{alternative = "two.sided"}.}

\item{perm_se}{a logical variable indicating whether to recompute the standard error for each
permutation (studentized permutation test). If \code{TRUE} (default), the standard error is
recomputed for each permuted sample, following the studentized permutation approach of
Janssen (1997) and Chung & Romano (2013), which is valid even under heteroscedasticity.
If \code{FALSE}, the standard error from the original sample is used for all permutations,
which is computationally faster but assumes homoscedasticity.}

\item{p_method}{the method for computing permutation p-values. Options are:
* \code{NULL} (default): Automatically selects "exact" for exact permutation tests (when all
permutations are enumerated) and "plusone" for randomization tests (when permutations
are sampled with replacement).
* \code{"exact"}: Uses b/R where b is the number of permutation statistics at least as extreme
as observed. Appropriate when all permutations are enumerated.
* \code{"plusone"}: Uses (b+1)/(R+1), which guarantees p > 0 and provides exact Type I
error control for randomization tests where permutations are sampled with replacement
(Phipson & Smyth, 2010).}

\item{keep_perm}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the permutation distribution of the test
statistic and effect sizes are stored in the output. Set to \code{FALSE} for large datasets
to save memory.}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form lhs ~ rhs where lhs is a numeric variable giving the data values and rhs either 1 for a one-sample test or a factor with two levels giving the corresponding groups. For paired tests, use the default method with x and y vectors instead of the formula method.}

\item{data}{an optional matrix or data frame (or similar: see model.frame) containing the variables in the formula formula. By default the variables are taken from environment(formula).}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used.}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs. Defaults to getOption("na.action").}

\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#maturing}{\figure{lifecycle-maturing.svg}{options: alt='[Maturing]'}}}{\strong{[Maturing]}}

Performs t-tests with permutation-based p-values and confidence intervals. This function supports
standard hypothesis testing alternatives as well as equivalence and minimal effect testing,
with optional trimmed means (Yuen's approach) for robust inference.
It can handle one-sample, two-sample (independent), and paired designs.
}
\details{
This function performs permutation-based t-tests, providing more robust inference than standard
parametric t-tests. It supports one-sample, two-sample (independent), and paired designs,
as well as five different alternative hypotheses.

The permutation procedure follows these steps:
\itemize{
\item Calculate the test statistic from the original data
\item Generate R permutation samples by randomly reassigning observations to groups
\item Calculate the test statistic for each permutation sample
\item Compute the p-value by comparing the original test statistic to the permutation distribution
\item Calculate confidence intervals using the percentile method
}

For one-sample and paired tests, permutation is performed by randomly flipping the signs of
the (centered) observations or difference scores.

For two-sample tests, permutation is performed by randomly reassigning observations to the
two groups. When \code{perm_se = TRUE} (default), the studentized permutation approach of
Janssen (1997) and Chung & Romano (2013) is used, which recomputes the standard error for
each permutation and is valid even under heteroscedasticity. When \code{perm_se = FALSE}, the
standard error from the original sample is used for all permutations, which is faster but
assumes equal variances.

When \code{tr > 0}, the function uses Yuen's trimmed t-test approach:
\itemize{
\item Trimmed means are computed by removing the fraction \code{tr} of observations from each tail
\item Winsorized variances are used in place of standard variances
\item This provides robustness against outliers and heavy-tailed distributions
}

For different alternatives, the p-values are calculated as follows:
\itemize{
\item "two.sided": Either symmetric (proportion of |T\*| >= |T|) or equal-tail
(2 * min of one-sided p-values) depending on the \code{symmetric} argument
\item "less": Proportion of T\* <= T
\item "greater": Proportion of T\* >= T
\item "equivalence": Maximum of two one-sided p-values (for lower and upper bounds)
\item "minimal.effect": Minimum of two one-sided p-values (for lower and upper bounds)
}

For two-sample tests, the test is of \eqn{\bar x - \bar y} (mean of x minus mean of y).
For paired samples, the test is of the difference scores (z),
wherein \eqn{z = x - y}, and the test is of \eqn{\bar z} (mean of the difference scores).
For one-sample tests, the test is of \eqn{\bar x} (mean of x).

If the number of possible permutations is less than R, all exact permutations are computed
and a message is printed to the console.

\section{Purpose}{

Use this function when:
\itemize{
\item You need more robust inference than provided by standard t-tests
\item You want to perform equivalence or minimal effect testing with permutation methods
\item Sample sizes are very small where standard or bootstrap approaches may be less reliable
\item You prefer the standard \code{htest} output format for compatibility with other R functions
\item You want an alternative that tests means, mean difference, or difference in means that can also utilize trimming
}

\section{Comparison with Other Packages}{

Results from \code{perm_t_test} may differ slightly from other permutation test implementations
such as \code{MKinfer::perm.t.test} or \code{coin::oneway_test}. These differences arise from
methodological choices:

\itemize{
\item \strong{P-value formula}: This function uses the \code{(b+1)/(R+1)} formula by default
(where \code{b} is the count of permutation statistics at least as extreme as observed),
which provides exact p-values that are never zero and guarantees correct Type I error
control (Phipson & Smyth, 2010). Some packages use \code{b/R} with strict inequality (\code{>}),
which excludes tied values and can produce p-values of exactly zero.
\item \strong{Studentized permutation}: By default (\code{perm_se = TRUE}), this function
recalculates the standard error for each permutation, following the studentized
approach of Janssen (1997). This provides valid inference even under heteroscedasticity
but may produce different results than non-studentized implementations.
\item \strong{Exact permutation detection}: This function automatically detects when exact
enumeration is feasible and computes all possible permutations, while some packages
may default to Randomization sampling regardless of sample size.
}

All approaches produce valid permutation tests; the differences reflect trade-offs between
conservatism, exactness, and robustness to assumption violations.
