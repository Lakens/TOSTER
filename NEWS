==============
TOSTER v0.3.3 (Release date: 2018-05-08)
==============

Changes:

* Error in order in which p-value 1 and p-value 2 were reported for TOSTr due to incorrect use of abs(r) in function. (thanks to Nils Kroemer and Dan Quintana)
* Fixed error in powerTOSTr function - instead of based on conversion to d, new function calculates directly from r and is more accurate.
* Added testthat folder and initial unit tests.

==============
TOSTER v0.3.2 (Release date: 2018-04-14)
==============

Changes:

* Error in sensitivity analyses of powerTOSTpaired.raw, powerTOSTone.raw, powerTOSTtwo.raw where output was in Cohen's d - now changed to output in raw scores, added sd to examples. (thanks to Lisa DeBruine)
* Raw power functions still output ceiling N in message, but exact N in output value

==============
TOSTER v0.3.1 (Release date: 2018-04-06)
==============

Changes:

* Error in TOSTpaired.raw where t-test for TOST multiplied by sdiff (copied from TOSTpaired function) removed. CI were correct, but p-values did not match. Now tests are correct. (thanks to ontogenerator)
* Changed text in TOSTr function (text copied from t-test script now changed to correlation)
