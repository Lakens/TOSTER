abstract = {Determining a lack of association between an outcome variable and a number of different explanatory variables is frequently necessary in order to disregard a proposed model (i.e., to confirm the lack of a meaningful association between an outcome and predictors). Despite this, the literature rarely offers information about, or technical recommendations concerning, the appropriate statistical methodology to be used to accomplish this task. This paper introduces non-inferiority tests for ANOVA and linear regression analyses, which correspond to the standard widely used F test for and R2, respectively. A simulation study is conducted to examine the Type I error rates and statistical power of the tests, and a comparison is made with an alternative Bayesian testing approach. The results indicate that the proposed non-inferiority test is a potentially useful tool for ‘testing the null’.},

	Abstract = {The statistical analysis of bioequivalence assessment has been consolidated in recent years through the work of Schuirmann [1987], Westlake [1988] and Hauschke et al. [1990], and this has been reflected in the CPMP Note for Guidance on Bioavailability and Bioequivalence and in the joint recommendations of the APV (International Association for Pharmaceutical Technology) and ZL (Central Laboratories of German Pharmacists) during a recent workshop in support of EC-Guidelines [Blume et al. 1990]. Since the decision procedure based on the inclusion of the shortest 90%-confidence interval in the bioequivalence range is the procedure of choice, and as this is equivalent to the two one-sided tests procedure, the sample size determination is based on the power of the latter. Following the approach of Phillips [1990] for the additive model, corresponding nomograms for the more relevant multiplicative model are given in this paper for various ratios of the expected means for test and reference and various coefficients of variation.},
