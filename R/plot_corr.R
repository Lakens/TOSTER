#' Function to produce plots of the distribution of standard correlation coefficients
#' @param r The observed correlation coefficient.
#' @param n Total number of observations (sample size).
#' @param method The method by which the coefficient was calculated: pearson, spearman, or kendall (default is "pearson")
#' @param type Choose whether to plot a "consonance" function ("c"), consonance density ("cd"), or both (c("c","cd"); defualt option).
#' @param levels Numeric vector of confidence levels to display
#' @details
#' This function was created so that users could create consonance plots of Pearson's correlation coefficient.
#' These types of plots are discussed by Schweder T, Hjort NL. (2016, ISBN:9781316445051) and Rafi Z, Greenland S. (2020) <doi:10.1186/s12874-020-01105-9>.
#' @return Returns plot of the distribution of the correlation coefficient.
#' @export
