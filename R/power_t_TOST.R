#' @title Power calculations for TOST for t-tests
#' @description  Calculates the exact power of two one sided t-tests (TOST) for one, two, and paired samples.
#' @param n number of observations per group. 2 sample sizes, in a vector, can be provided for the two sample case.
#' @param delta true difference in means (default is 0)
#' @param sd population standard deviation. Standard deviation of the differences for paired samples
#' @param eqb Equivalence bound. Can provide 1 value (negative value is taken as the lower bound) or 2 specific values that represent the upper and lower equivalence bounds.
#' @param low_eqbound Lower equivalence bounds. Deprecated use eqb.
#' @param high_eqbound Upper equivalence bounds. Deprecated use eqb.
#' @param alpha a priori alpha-level (i.e., significance level)
#' @param power power of the TOST procedure (1-beta)
#' @param type string specifying the type of t-test.
#' @details
#' The exact calculations of power are based on Owen’s Q-function or by direct integration of the bivariate non-central t-distribution (inspired by the PowerTOST package).
#' Approximate power is implemented via the non-central t-distribution or the ‘shifted’ central t-distribution.
#' @note
#' The power function in this package is limited. Please see the PowerTOST R package for more options.
