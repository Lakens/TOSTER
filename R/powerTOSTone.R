#' Power analysis for TOST for one-sample t-test (Cohen's d).
#' @param alpha alpha used for the test (e.g., 0.05)
#' @param statistical_power desired power (e.g., 0.8)
#' @param N sample size (e.g., 108)
#' @param low_eqbound_d lower equivalence bounds (e.g., -0.5) expressed in standardized mean difference (Cohen's d)
#' @param high_eqbound_d upper equivalence bounds (e.g., 0.5) expressed in standardized mean difference (Cohen's d)
#' @return Calculate either achieved power, equivalence bounds, or required N, assuming a true effect size of 0.
#' Returns a string summarizing the power analysis, and a numeric variable for number of observations, equivalence bounds, or power.
