#**Tests against Literature, existing packages, and MiniTab**

Below I reproduce some examples from the literature, compare TOSTER against other R packages that have equivalence test functions, and against Minitab. MiniTab software has implemented equivalence tests and power analysis for one-sample, independent, and paired t-tests. It is excellent - by far the most user-friendly software for anyone who prefers a commercial statistics program over an open source solution (it also has equivalence tests for 2x2 crossover designs, but not for correlations or meta-analysis). It also allows users to enter summary statistics, which is used here to compare the output of the equivalence functions in TOSTER against minitab. Note that when SD  = 1, the mean difference equals the standardized difference. The MiniTab output is followed by the R function.


#**TOST for two independent samples**


##*Example 1.1*

From page 196 of Stegner, B. L., Bostrom, A. G., & Greenfield, T. K. (1996). Equivalence testing for use in psychosocial and services research: An introduction with examples. Evaluation and Program Planning, 19(3), 193-198. https://doi.org/10.1016/0149-7189(96)00011-0

Randomized controlled trial of two conditions of case management, with the main dependent variable being ratings on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The means, sd's, and sample sizes are: 

Control: M = 1.5679, SD = 0.4285, n = 64
Experimental: M = 1.6764, SD = 0.4748, n = 70

Calculated t-values for TOST are t1 = 5.383 and t2 = -2.616

These results can be reproduced with TOSTER package and the TOSTtwo.raw R code: 

```{r}
require(TOSTER)
TOSTtwo.raw(m1=1.5679,m2=1.6764,sd1=0.4285,sd2=0.4748,n1=64,n2=70,low_eqbound=-0.3136, high_eqbound=0.3136,alpha=0.05, var.equal=TRUE)

```


##*Example 1.2*

From page 225 of Limentani, G. B., Ringo, M. C., Ye, F., Bergquist, M. L., & MCSorley, E. O. (2005). Beyond the t-test: statistical equivalence testing. Analytical Chemistry, 77(11), 221-A.

Reproducing the 90% CI and significant equivalence test.

```{r}
TOSTtwo.raw(m1=89.3,m2=87.7,sd1=1.9,sd2=1.3,n1=12,n2=12,low_eqbound=-3.7, high_eqbound=3.7,alpha=0.05, var.equal=TRUE)

```


#*Example 1.3*

From Meyners, M. (2012). Equivalence tests - A review. Food Quality and Preference, 26(2), 231-245. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2012.05.003, page 237:

To illustrate the approach, we consider the data presented by Bi (2005) of 100 consumers each from two cities A and B, giving overall liking scores on a 9-point scale. The equivalence margin is set to d = 0.5, i.e. a difference of 0.5 or less in mean values is considered negligible. With mean values of lA = 7.1 and lB = 6.9 and variances s2A = 2.0 and s2B = 2.2, the corresponding t-statistic is 0.976, and the
p-values for the two one-sided test problems become p1 = 0.0717 and p2 = 0.0003.

We can use the TOST procedure for an independent t-test to reproduce the p-values and 90% CI:

```{r}
TOSTtwo.raw(m1=7.1, m2=6.9, sd1=sqrt(2.0), sd2=sqrt(2.2), n1=100, n2=100,low_eqbound=-0.5, high_eqbound=0.5,alpha=0.05, var.equal=TRUE)

```
This outcome matches the result of (page 237): The 90% CI is [0.139; 0.539] with a p-value of approximately 0.07.  


##*Example 1.4*

From Table 1 in Quertemont, E. (2011). How to Statistically Show the Absence of an Effect. Psychologica Belgica, 51(2), 109. https://doi.org/10.5334/pb-51-2-109

Example 1: t(8) = 1.52; p = 0.92
Example 2: t(298) = -2.23; p = 0.013

```{r}
#Example 1
TOSTtwo.raw(m1=459.09, m2=402.61, sd1=47.53, sd2=38.42, n1=5, n2=5, low_eqbound=-15, high_eqbound=15,alpha=0.05, var.equal=TRUE)

#Example 2
TOSTtwo.raw(m1=407.24, m2=402.98, sd1=41.77, sd2=41.79, n1=150, n2=150, low_eqbound=-15, high_eqbound=15,alpha=0.05, var.equal=TRUE)

```

These results perfectly match those in Table 1 of Quertemont (2011).


##*Example 1.5*

MiniTab by default uses Welch's t-test when testing for equivalence, which does not require the assumption of equal variances, which matters with unequal sample sizes. TOSTER also presents Welch's t-test by default. Note that minitab rounds degrees of freedom down to a whole number. This is a conservative procedure. TOSTER does not. The difference is rarely noticable.

#**Paired t-test**

##*Example 2.1*

We can compare the TOSTpaired.raw function against the equivalence package. 

Paired t-test in equivalence package (from example in tost function) and TOSTpaired.raw.

```{r}
require(equivalence)
data(ufc)
#Remove missing data
ufc<-ufc[complete.cases(ufc[,9:10]),]
      
tost(ufc$Height.m.p, ufc$Height.m, epsilon = 1, paired = TRUE)

TOSTpaired.raw(n=length(ufc$Height.m.p),m1=mean(ufc$Height.m.p,na.rm = TRUE), m2=mean(ufc$Height.m,na.rm = TRUE), sd1=sd(ufc$Height.m.p,na.rm = TRUE), sd2=sd(ufc$Height.m,na.rm = TRUE), r12=cor(ufc$Height.m,ufc$Height.m.p, use="pairwise.complete.obs"), low_eqbound=-1,high_eqbound=1, alpha=0.05)
```


##*Example 2.2*

Quertemont also provides an example for paired t-tests in the appendix (page 124):
Mdif = 1, SDif = 1.58, d = .5, t = 0.71, df = 4, p = .74 with a 95% CI from -.96 to + 2.96.

```{r}
morning<-c(3,4,4,5,4)
evening<-c(1,4,1,4,5)

TOSTpaired.raw(n=5,m1=mean(morning), m2=mean(evening), sd1=sd(morning), sd2=sd(evening), r12=cor(morning,evening), low_eqbound=-0.5,high_eqbound=0.5, alpha=0.05)
```

This output matches the calculations in Quertemont (2011).


##*Example 2.3*


MiniTab does not allow users to perform equivalence tests for paired samples t-test based on summary data, but this equivalence test can be calculated based on the raw data.

DV1<-c(4,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,4,2,3,4,5,5)

#**Equivalence test for correlations**

##*Example 4.1*

Quertemont (2011) provides an example in the appendix (page 126): Suppose a sample with N = 50, r = .1, and d = .2, and calculated that p(Z < -0.70) = .24. The confidence interval for r is -0.18 to 0.37

We can reproduce this result using the TOSTr function: 

```{r}
TOSTr(n=50, r = 0.1, low_eqbound_r=-0.2, high_eqbound_r=0.2, alpha=0.05)

```
The resulting p-value and 95% CI match the calculations by Quertemont (2011).


##*Example 4.2*

The R code from Goertzen & Cribbie, page 536, was used:

```{r}
#Running an original two t test procedure for equivalence
#######
equivint<-0.3
corxy<-0.02
n<-100
alpha<-0.05

zei <-log((1 + equivint)/(1 - equivint))/2
zcorxy <-log((1 + corxy)/(1-corxy))/2
equivt1_fz <-(zcorxy - zei)/(1/sqrt(n - 3))
pvalue1_fz <-pnorm(equivt1_fz)
equivt2_fz <-(zcorxy + zei)/(1/sqrt(n - 3))
pvalue2_fz <-1 - pnorm(equivt2_fz)
ifelse (pvalue1_fz <= alpha & pvalue2_fz <= alpha, decis_fz <-"The null hypothesis that the correlation between var1 and var2 falls outside of the equivalence interval can be rejected.", decis_fz <-"The null hypothesis that the correlation between var1 and var2 falls outside of the equivalence interval cannot be rejected.")
pvalue1_fz
pvalue2_fz
```


Which is identical to the p-values observed in the spreadsheet, and returned by the the TOSTr function:
```{r}
TOSTr(n=100, r = 0.02, low_eqbound_r=-0.3, high_eqbound_r=0.3, alpha=0.05)

```

#**Meta-analaysis based on Cohen's d**

##*Example 5.1*

We can reproduce an example for a meta-analysis from From Rogers, J. L., Howard, K. I., & Vessey, J. T. (1993). Using significance tests to evaluate equivalence between two experimental groups. Psychological Bulletin, 113(3), page 557.


For example, we obtain the following calculations for the cognitive versus behavioral contrast. Traditional z: z = ES/SE = 0.12/0.09 = 1.333, p = .091.
Traditional confidence interval: ES ? (za/2)(SE) = 0.12 ? (1.96)(0.09), or -0.056 to 0.296.
Equivalence z: 
z1 = (ES + 0.20)/SE = (0.12 + 0.20)/0.09 = 3.556, p = .000.
z2 = (ES - Q.2Q)/SE = (0.12 - 0.20)/0.09 = -0.889, p= .187.
So we table the larger p value of 0.187.
Equivalence confidence interval:
ES ? (za)(SE) = 0.12 ? (1.645)(0.09), or -0.028 to 0.268.

We can recreate this with the TOSTmeta function:
```{r}
TOSTmeta(ES=0.12, var=0.0081, se=0.09, low_eqbound_d=-0.2, high_eqbound_d=0.2, alpha=0.05)
```

#**TOST for two proportions**

##*Example 6.1*

Walker, E., & Nowacki, A. S. (2011), applies an equivalence test for the difference between two proportions to data from Staszewski, S., Keiser, P., Montaner, J., Raffi, F., Gathe, J., Brotas, V., ... & Tortell, S. (2001), comparing the response rates of two treatments for HIV. 

The following proportions were reported: prop1 = 133/262, prop2 = 136/265. 
The equivalence bounds were set to a proportion difference of +/- 12%. 
The confidence level for the TOST CI was set to 95%, so alpha was (1-TOST.CI)/2 = 0.025

Walker, E., & Nowacki, A. S. (2011) reports the following confidence intervals for the TOST: Lower = -0.09, upper = 0.08. 

We can recreate these confidence intervals with the `TOSTtwo.prop` function.

```{r}
TOSTtwo.prop(prop1 =  133/262,
             prop2 =  136/265,
             n1 = 262,
             n2 = 265, 
             low_eqbound = -0.12,
             high_eqbound = 0.12, 
             alpha = 0.025, 
             plot = TRUE)
```



##*Example 6.2*

O'reilly, R., Bishop, J., Maddox, K., Hutchinson, L., Fisman, M., & Takhar, J. (2007), compared the clinical efficiency of face-to-face- vs telepsychiatry. They tested the proportions of both the return to normal levels on a symptom inventory, and hospitalization in the first year after treatment.

For return to normal levels on symptom inventory...
The following proportions were reported: prop1 = 29/148, prop2 = 30/138.
The equivalence bounds were set to a proportion difference of +/- 15%. 
The confidence level for the TOST CI was set to 90%, so alpha was (1-TOST.CI)/2 = 0.05

The authors only report the lower end of the interval: Lower = -0.10

We can recreate this value with the `TOSTtwo.prop` function.

```{r}
TOSTtwo.prop(prop1 =  29/148,
             prop2 =  30/138,
             n1 = 148,
             n2 = 138, 
             low_eqbound = -0.15,
             high_eqbound = 0.15, 
             alpha = 0.05, 
             plot = TRUE)
```

For hospitalization post treatment...
The following proportions were reported: prop1 = 18/246, prop2 = 15/224.
The equivalence bounds were set to a proportion difference of +/- 10%. 
The confidence level for the TOST CI was set to 90%, so alpha was (1-TOST.CI)/2 = 0.05

The authors only report the lower end of the interval: Lower = -0.03

We can recreate this value with the `TOSTtwo.prop` function.

```{r}
TOSTtwo.prop(prop1 =  18/246,
             prop2 =  15/224,
             n1 = 246,
             n2 = 224, 
             low_eqbound = -0.10,
             high_eqbound = 0.10, 
             alpha = 0.05, 
             plot = TRUE)

```
